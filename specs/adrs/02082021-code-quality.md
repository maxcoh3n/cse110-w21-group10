# Auto Code Quality Tool

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: entirety of group
* Date: 2021-02-08

## Context and Problem Statement

We needed to consolidate our preliminary research and decide on which auto code quality tool to incorporate.

## Decision Drivers

* Need a utility to be able to check for test coverage, comment coverage
* Need one that is free

## Considered Options

* Codacy
* Code Climate

## Decision Outcome

* Chosen option: Code Climate

Code Climate is a free browser extension that allows for inline code review, integrated test coverage, a letter/color grading system, and code review comments on pull requests.

Codacy had a free trial, but that involved us rotating our student account free trials in order to avoid paying, which seemed like a hassle and Code Climate seemed to check the boxes that we had.

## Caveats/Workarounds

Code Climate only works for a public repository, so we will have to make it public when we plan to use Code Climate

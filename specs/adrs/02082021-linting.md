# Linting

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: entirety of group

## Context and Problem Statement

We needed to consolidate our preliminary research and decide on which linting tool to use.

## Decision Drivers

* Need to be sure that our code is easily readable by others, especially for the purpose of human review of PRs
* Readable code is maintainable code

## Considered Options

* Prettier Code-Formatter

## Decision Outcome

* Chosen option: Prettier Code-Formatter

Prettier Code-Formatter is language-flexible (will be using it with HTML, CSS, JavaScript). It can help catch syntax errors and some logic errors in addition to ensuring a consistent style across each team member's code.

This is also a VSCode extension and thus makes it easy to integrate into peoples' existing workflows. Other code formatters interacted with code pushed to Github, but we decided that was too late into the development process and would prefer immediate feedback on styling.

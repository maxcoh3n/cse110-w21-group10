# Should we implement TaskId/how should we handle duplicate task names in a day when 1 is completed

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Max, Jerry, Matthew, Anthony
* Date: 2021-09-03

## Context and Problem Statement

Should we implement taskID into upcomingTasks/CompletedSessions?
If we don't how do we best fix the bug where a user completes a task and then in the same day, enters the same name

## Decision Drivers

* how long taskID will take
* Pomodoro philosophy

## Considered Options

* taskID, each 2 objects in completedSessions can be 2 tasks
* no taskID, 2 objects in completed sessions are always different tasks

## Decision Outcome

* No taskId because every separate entry in sessions will be a separate task
* if you do not complete a task on that day, it will forever be false
* if you work on a task with the same name on the same day, it goes back into in progress and completed is turned from true to false


### Details of what statistics will be displayed and what values they will use

* Average number of sessions to complete a task

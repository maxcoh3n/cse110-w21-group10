## Team Values
The Keyboard warriors value communication and coordination. Communication is important to the Keyboard Warriors because the lack of \
communication can lead to bigger problems during a project. If a team member has any problems or difficulties in finishing their part \
for an assignment, it is better to communicate with the team rather than keep the problem to themself until it is too late. In order to \
get work done, team members must feel free to reach out to others for any help. Coordination is important to the Keyboard Warriors because\
meeting with the team often to set clear goals for the week is vital for our success. Having regular meetings and setting a goal each meeting \
allows us to designate clear tasks for each team member that needs to be completed by a specific deadline. 

## Team Rules
In general, the Keyboard Warriors agree to:
* Using and checking slack often for primary communication
* Filling out When2Meet within a day of receiving it
* Attempt to attend all meetings
* Communicate to the team about any problems \

## What was discussed

- We are gettting rid of number of pomos
- go automatically from work into break,
  - requires manual selection of task to go from break into work
- you can add new tasks whenever the start button is visible
- start button is visible after break ends, and it's waiting for you to start a new task
- which task you are on (out of 4) will be held in a global array, not localStorage
- if no tasks on task list, you can still start the timer and will log "unnamed task
- you can only have one task highlighted at a time, if you lick completed then there's a strikethru
- task list is a radio input
- below begin, big box that says Current Task [task selected] or none selected
  - none selected only if task list is empty
- add completed button to right of tasks header above task list
  - if you push the button while a task is selected, it disappears
  - automatically select first task on list always

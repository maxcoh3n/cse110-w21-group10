## what was discussed

- each team presented
- seems that we are a bit behind in terms of group roles, plans, etc
- we did not have slides while others did, though they were quite short
- however, most have not started brainstormin yet

## advice from Sasya

 - no strict deliverables after this week
   - just whatever we are working on
 - GO THROUGH EXISTING APPS AS A TEAM
    - decide what is good and what is bad
- think from end user's perspective: what is the goal
    - what are we looking for when we use pomo timer
- on friday of each week we should know what is expected for discussion

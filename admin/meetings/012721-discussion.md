- Noah
- Navid

## what was discussed

each team presented
seems that we are a bit behind in terms of group roles, plans, etc
however, most have not started brainstormin yet

## advice from Sasya

 no strict deliverables after this week
    just whatever we are working on
 GO THROUGH EXISTING APPS AS A TEAM
    decide what is good and what is bad
think from end user's perspective: what is the goal
    what are we looking for when we use pomo timer
